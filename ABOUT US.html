<h3> History </h3>
<p><img src="kuok.jpg" alt="Kuok" style="float:right;width:300px;height:300px;"> In the year 1949, Robert Kuok founded the Kuok group in Hong Kong. However, it wasnâ€™t until 1971 that the first Shangri-La hotel would open in Singapore under the management of Western International Hotels. By 1979, Shangri-La had started to manage itself with the founding of Shangri-La International Hotel Management Ltd. in 2010, and the handling of three properties under Kuok Hotels. After their massive success in Asia, they extended to Europe in 2010 with their hotel in Paris. To this day, the Shangri-La group still remains part of the Kuok group and expands its reaches across Asia and even in places beyond.
