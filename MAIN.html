      <h3>What is Home</h3>
      <p>Home is the place you are most comfortable with. Home can be family, friends, or where memories can grow. Homes can be represented by a house as well as a literal definition. That is why we at Real Living makes sure that your soon to be house could be a home for you and for many. A place of refuge for people to find comfort with those people that they love. Imagine, that world where you would continually build upon, where your lineage will grow and heritages made and the thought of bonds forged by this medium carrying a soul. </p>
